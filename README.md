# Assignment-4-Panda-challenge
This is the week 4 module challenge with Panda as the challenge

This contains four files;
- Word doc - the writen report which explains what the data results means and interpret on the data to provide a valid conclusion and summary
- Panda_assignment.ipynb - the code sheet which was written in Jupyter notebook with Panda. This is the main source of code which I've used to obtain the various data charts
- Resources - mainly where the two csv files were stored in order to read and edit the data (there was no changes to the csv files)
- ReadME.md - the text file which explains what is in the challenge module.
